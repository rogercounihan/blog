      <description>We closed on a new cottage on Lake Nottely in North Georgia two weeks ago, and have started to spend our spare weekend time up there.
It is a very small cottage, with a beautiful view of a mountain and the water. It has multiple balconies and patios which we will likely spend a significant amount of our time on. The inside is currently fairly dark, with the exception of the master bedroom.</description>
