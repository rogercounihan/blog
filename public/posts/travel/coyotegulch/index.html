            <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>In October 2018, my brother and I did a quick three day hike in Coyote Gulch, within the Grand Staircase National Monument, outside Escalante, UT.  Julian’s son’s due date was November 28th, so we were barely getting this trip in.</p>
<p>Our initial target was Zion NP, but based on concerns about crowding, and the trans-Zion trek being significantly impacted because of access limitations in the northwest corner of the park, we honed in on Grand Staircase outside of Escalante.  I had seen some incredible photography from the area, and this seemed like a perfect opportunity to go and explore.</p>
<p>Hiking I am familiar with includes robust trail maps, clear trips reports, and easy to follow packing instructions.  This trip however, proved to be different.  Trail guidance is to simply follow the river, find your way through canyons, or follow some cairns.  We wanted to build a loop, and after staring at a topo map enough, I eventually figured out a potential route&hellip; <br>
&hellip; If we could access the final trail head <br>
&hellip; If we got there in time <br>
&hellip; If the river wasn’t too cold <br></p>
<p>The theme being we knew generally where we wanted to go, but the actual routing was going to have to be played by ear.  I knew that travel speed wasn’t going to be the same as on the AT for example, but I didn’t know how different.  I didn’t know how deep the rivers were going to be - turned out there was a rare monsoon storm in Utah the week before we arrived.  Even down to what type of shoes to bring - boots, sneakers, or even sandals was unclear at the planning stage of the trip.</p>
<p>It turned out that not knowing, and preparing for the unknown, contributed to creating a level of flexibility and a lack of aggressive expectations that allowed us to really just enjoy ourselves, observe the surroundings, and take in the trip.  our route changed continuously, based on unavoidable obstacles or bad read of the map, which forced us to continually adjust our plans.</p>
<h3 id="day-1-travel-and-start">Day 1 Travel and Start</h3>
<p>We flew into Vegas and landed on Thursday morning approximately 10am.  Only when I landed did I realize Vegas is in the pacific time zone, and our destination was Mountain time. This added a virtual hour to our drive.  Our day was already tight as we were fighting an early sunset.</p>
<p>We rented a small, basic  pickup.  It wasn&rsquo;t ideal for the 5 hours of highway we had, but it was perfect for the final 45 minutes from Escalante to the trailhead. On the way, we stopped for gas, sandwiches, and water.  Otherwise, all of our food and other gear we brought in from home.</p>
<p>Knowing the sunset was early, we drove down the sand road at considerable speed, and rushed to the trailhead.</p>

<p>After getting repacking quickly, we walked a mile down the trail onto the desert, and setup camp.  As complete darkness came down, we warmed up some dinner.  Darkness was short lived however, it was a very full moon and the moon-rise was dramatic.</p>

<h3 id="day-2-morning">Day 2 Morning</h3>
<p>While Julian slept in on Friday morning, I attempted to take some sunrise pictures. I immediately recognized that I should have brought my tripod. Trying to get perspective from the ground, using a Gorillapod, was impossible.  I suppose they could work in a world where there are conveniently placed trees on a regular basis, but in a rock/tree filled desert, I was really missing out on some great long exposure shots with reflections and dramatic lighting.</p>

<p>We boiled up some coffee, and headed to find the &ldquo;Crack-In-The-Wall&rdquo; descent into the Escalante River canyon. Walking up to the edge was intimidating, but getting down was a simply shimmy behind a rock wall, and lowering the packs down the side.  The view of the canyon was incredible though, and gave us our first idea of the scenery we were in for while we hiked.</p>

<p>Beyond Crack-In-The-Wall, it was a sandy descent.  We forked to the north to get the exit of Coyote Gulch onto the Escalante river.  At the bottom of Coyote Gulch, we headed East.  Our original plan was to find the Escalante river, head north, then make a loop by climbing up over King Mesa to the start of Coyote Gulch.</p>

<p>We had to adapt, as we were unable to navigate the river or find any trail from Coyote Gulch to the confluence with the Escalante.  Other references seemed to show a route crossing the Escalante, but it may have been by a different route from Crack in the Wall directly to the Escalante river.</p>
<h3 id="day-2-coyote-gulch-escalante-river-to-sleepy-hollow-side-canyon">Day 2 Coyote Gulch: Escalante River to Sleepy Hollow Side Canyon</h3>
<p>After a replanning session, we headed west, up Coyote Gulch.  Once that decision was made, the hike was simple - follow the river.  Most of the time there is a primitive trail along the river, but 30%-40% of the time we were hiking directly in the river.</p>
<p>And the hiking was incredible.  500 foot sheer red walls on either side, often hanging over us.  The canyon floor was much narrower then the walls, making for a very up-close and direct experience.  The bottom of the canyon was lush, with grasses, trees, and flowers.</p>

<p>From where we started walking up the Escalante River, until reaching Hamblin Arch, it was about a three hour walk up the river.  Shortly before reaching the arch, we stopped and grabeed lunch.  We passed through Coyote Natural Bridge, the Swiss Cheese Water falls, and then got to the Hamblin Arch.  It was very impressive.  From the arch we continued our way up the river, either straight in the middle of the stream or on muddy trails on either side, until we found a campsite at the base of the Sleepy Hollow Side Canyon, which we planned on exploring heading up the next day.</p>

<h3 id="day-3-morning">Day 3 Morning</h3>
<h3 id="day-3-climb-out">Day 3 Climb Out</h3>
<p>We reached the base of the Hamlin Arch ADD GPS COORDINATES, and eyeballed are newest challenge - climbing out at the XX exit.</p>
<p>Wow - it was challenging.  Scrambling with small finger holds and toes on ledges - this wasn’t a hike out as much of a climb.  Not a long climb, maybe 150-200 ft, but certainly it was not fun to look down or take a pause.  There’s not a clear route that we could see, although another photographer had dropped a rope about 20 feet over from where we stood.  Once our adrenalin had subsided - we realized that climbing with 30-40lb packs was also not the smartest thing - we should have dropped some rope and then pulled the bags up.  They certainly don’t help balance or style.</p>
<p>Didn’t get too many pictures - it wasn’t a huge focus area for us at the time - here’s a shot from another site XXX - JULIAN Climbout Picture etc&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="finish">Finish</h3>
<p>From the top of the Hamlin exit, we cut across the desert until we found our car - a quick 2 mile walk over sand and rock.  The contrast between the top of the canyon and the bottom of the gulch is hard to describe - hot and dry vs. wet and cool.</p>
<p>Once we were back to the car, we cleaned off the sand, sent the drone for a quick cruise, and made our way back to Escalante for a pizza at: XXX</p>
