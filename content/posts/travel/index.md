### Introduction

In October 2018, my brother Julian Counihan and I did a quick 3 day hike in Coyote Gulch, within the Grand Staircase National Monument, outside Escalante, UT.  Building a trip plan, developing and finding a route, was all incredibly complicated, so I wanted to put forth a bit of a trip log, and use it as an excuse to display my photographs.


My friends in Atlanta had introduced me to the concept of a ‘Dadchelor’ party - celebrating the end of free time and flexibility that comes with new responsibilities of a newborn.  Julian’s son’s due date was November 28th, so we were barely getting this trip in.


Our initial target was Zion NP, but based on concerns about crowding, and the trans-Zion trek being significantly impacted because of access limitations in the NW corner of the park, we honed in on Grand Staircase NM outside of Escalante.  I had seen some incredible photography from the area, and this seemed like a perfect opportunity to get over there and explore.


Previous hiking Julian and I were familiar with included robust trail maps, clear trips reports, and easy to follow packing instructions.  This trip however, proved to be different.  Trail guidance is to simply follow the river, find your way through canyons, or follow some cairns.  We wanted to build a loop, and after staring at a topo map enough, I eventually figured out a potential route.

- If we could access the final trail head
- If we got there in time
- If the river wasn’t too cold

The theme being we knew generally where we wanted to go, but the actual routing was going to have to be played by ear.  I knew that travel speed wasn’t going to be the same as on the AT for example, but I didn’t know how different.  I didn’t know how deep the rivers were going to be - turned out there was a rare monsoon storm in Utah the week before we arrived.  Even down to what type of shoes to bring - boots, sneakers, or even sandals was unclear at the planning stage of the trip.

It turned out that not knowing, that preparing for the unknown, contributed to creating a level of flexibility and a lack of aggressive expectations that allowed us to really just enjoy ourselves, observe the surroundings, and take in the trip.  We had to continually adapt our route, based on unavoidable obstacles or bad map reading, which forced us to continually adjust to the trip.

### Day 1 Travel and Start

We flew into Vegas, and landed on Thursday morning approximately 10am.  Plans went into flux quickly when we realized that Vegas is PST, and our destination was Mountain time. This added a virtual hour to our drive.  Our day was tight, as we were fighting an early sunset.


We rented a Nissan Frontier, a basic compact pickup.  It wasn't ideal for the 5 hours of highway we had, but it was ideal for the final 45 minutes from Escalante to the trailhead.  {LOOKUP MAP}.  On the way, we stopped for gas, sandwiches, and water.  Otherwise, all of our food and other gear {LINK TO GEAR LIST} we brought in from home.

Knowing the sunset was early, we drove down the sand road at considerable speed, and rushed to the trailhead.  

### Day 2 Morning

Julian slept in on our first morning (the first of many accomodations) - but that afforded me some time to take some sunrise pictures.  I think at this point I immediately recognized that I should have brought my tripod.  And cut down on the number of olives I carried.
