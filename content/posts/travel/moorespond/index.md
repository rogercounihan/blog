On Saturday we drove from Atlanta to a house on a small farm we rented south east of Asheville, NC in Fairview.  The house has a beautiful view of some NC mountains, a pond with geese and ducks, and sheep wondering around the property.  There are hiking trails we haven't really explored yet, a coy pond that Francis and Avery enjoy watching through the window, and a horseshoe set across the driveway.

After arriving, the kids set out to explore the trails, while we unpacked, and then we headed down to the pond for a tour around the fields.  The grass was long around our shins, but there weren't bugs, and the ground was easy to walk through.  We rushed through the first two gates, went down the steep hill, and then followed a path around to the goats. After many iPhone searches, it turns out they are sheep.  Potentially ill-tempered, but we were able to rub there noses, and get up-close.
