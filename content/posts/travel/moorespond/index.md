On Saturday we drove from Atlanta to a house on a small farm we rented south east of Asheville, NC in Fairview.  The house has a beautiful view of some NC mountains, a pond with geese and ducks, and sheep wondering around the property.  There are hiking trails we haven't really explored yet, a coy pond that Francis and Avery enjoy watching through the window, and a horseshoe set across the driveway.

After arriving, the kids set out to explore the trails, while we unpacked, and then we headed down to the pond for a tour around the fields.  The grass was long around our shins, but there weren't bugs, and the ground was easy to walk through.  We rushed through the first two gates, went down the steep hill, and then followed a path around to the goats. After many iPhone searches, it turns out they are sheep.  Potentially ill-tempered, but we were able to rub there noses, and get up-close.

### Sunday

Sunday, we woke up, and Melissa made a big pancake breakfast.  We set out and drove to Catawba Falls, east of Asheville, in Old Fort.  It was a nice, 1.5 mile walk along a creek to a very beautiful waterfall.  We played in the river beneath the falls, then as it started to get crowded, we walked back a little bit, and played in the creek for a bit longer.  

We stopped in Black Mountain for takeout BBQ then drove home for lunch.  After a nap, I worked out on the hill, relaxed through a rain shower, then hit the Whistle Hop brewery in Fairview for dinner and some fun in a black tube slide.

### Monday

Monday morning we debated heading out as the clouds and rain rolled past our front window.  Deciding to risk it, we drove over to the south entrance of Pisgah National Forest.  We started at Looking Glass falls, then headed to Slide Rock.  We all made one slide down, but got a bit emotional and intimidated at the top, and decided to not make a second run.  Returning down the road slightly, we went to an open creek to play around in the water for a few minutes.  The water was cool and refreshing, and deep enough to float on my back for a few meters at a time. 

After getting changed, we enjoyed 45 minutes on the Blue Ridge parkway, and then lunch and a flight of beer at the Wicked Weed brewery in the south slope neighborhood of Asheville.  There were a number of breweries nearby, but the energy was very low as NC is seeing a surge of CV-19 cases, and people are cautious.  After lunch we headed back to the house for a short nap, exercise on the hill, and our evening walk around with the sheep.

### Tuesday

We decided to simply relax at home and enjoy the Moore's Pond farm.  Francis and I took the canoe out, we went for a walk up the trail behind the house, and had lunch from the nearby Amish deli.

### Wednesday

We drove on the Blue Ridge Parkway about 15 miles northeast from Asheville to the Craggy Gardens Picnic Area.  From there we hiked about a mile each way to the visitors center on the other side of the knob.  The views were pretty, we found some open areas and some good trees to climb.  We just missed the blooming season of the Catawba Rhododendrens, which are the red and purple flowers that are a canopy during June in North Carolina.  After the hike, we enjoyed a mini picnic on a bench before driving back down the Blue Ridge.

After a nap, we decided to check out the Turgua Brewery, which was nearby.  It was a cool spot, the brewery is bordered by a creek, so the kids were able to play and get muddy while Melissa and I each had a couple pints.  There were a few families hanging out...you could imagine that during non-pandemic times it would be a great spot for families to hang out and get together.
