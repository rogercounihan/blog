On Saturday we drove from Atlanta to a house on a small farm we rented south east of Asheville, NC in Fairview.  The house has a beautiful view of some NC mountains, a pond with geese and ducks, and sheep wondering around the property.  There are hiking trails we haven't really explored yet, a coy pond that Francis and Avery enjoy watching through the window, and a horseshoe set across the driveway.

After arriving, the kids set out to explore the trails, while we unpacked, and then we headed down to the pond for a tour around the fields.  The grass was long around our shins, but there weren't bugs, and the ground was easy to walk through.  We rushed through the first two gates, went down the steep hill, and then followed a path around to the goats. After many iPhone searches, it turns out they are sheep.  Potentially ill-tempered, but we were able to rub there noses, and get up-close.

Sunday, we woke up, and Melissa made a big pancake breakfast.  We set out and drove to Catawba Falls, east of Asheville, in Old Fort.  It was a nice, 1.5 mile walk along a creek to a very beautiful waterfall.  We played in the river beneath the falls, then as it started to get crowded, we walked back a little bit, and played in the creek for a bit longer.  

We stopped in Black Mountain for takeout BBQ then drove home for lunch.  After a nap, I worked out on the hill, relaxed through a rain shower, then hit the Whistle Hop brewery in Fairview for dinner and some fun in a black tube slide.

Monday morning we debated heading out as the clouds and rain rolled past our front window.  Deciding to risk it, we drove over to the south entrance of Pisgah National Forest.  We started at Looking Glass falls, which was very impressive.
