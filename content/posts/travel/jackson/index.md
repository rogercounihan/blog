### Introduction

After complaining enough about not getting a quick west coast ski trip in, Melissa offered to let me take a few days to myself in Jackson Hole prior to meeting with the family in Steamboat for our usual winter family ski trip.

### Arrival & Scouting

I arrived at Jackson Hole airport around midday, and after somehow losing my luggage at the worlds smallest airport, jumped in the rental car and started scouting locations.  Driving north into Grand Teton National Park, I scoped out Glacier View, Snake River View, and a couple other turnouts from the road.

February 2019 set multiple snow records for Jackson, and the pulloffs required a climb up a four to six foot wall of snow and ice.  The clouds were also low, only exposing the first 800-1000 feet of the Teton mountain range, but gentle enough to provide some great soft light on the pillowy cliffs and misty trees over the Snake River.  

In addition to the pull-offs, I drove far enough to see a heard of bison at the entrance to a ranch - the first I've seen those.  They are huge - and were close enough to me that I was a bit nervous of parking too close, and definitely didn't get out of the car.

I made a few attempts at walking off a few of the pull-offs, but it was clearly snow-shoe conditions, as I sunk in the snow up to my waist everytime I attempted to get off the road.  I thought about finding a pair of snow-shoes this trip, but the days were short and busy, and I didn't end up picking up a pair.

Later that evening, I went back and out explored the Gros-Ventre road.  A bit east of highway 192, and further from the mountains, this was more of a boone for wildlife and moody landscape shots.  I wasn't quite feeling my groove that first evening, but did spot a few places to explore in the future, and spotted two coyotes (I have to admit - I thought they were wolves at first).  The small town of Kelly (Wikipedia link for Kelly?) really surprised me most of all.

I drove home in the dark, needing to get unpacked and set up for a long first day of shooting and riding.

### First Full Day

#### Sunrise Attempt #1

With a 5am wakeup, I had plenty of time for coffee and getting dressed.  I drove from my hotel near Jackson town square up to Glacier overlook.  I got there in the dark before sunrise, channeling every youtube photographer I follow, but it was obvious the mountains were fully shrouded that first morning.  With the temps hovering around -20F / (( ADD CELSIUS ))

I headed back up Gros Ventrev road, looking for some scenery, and caught a bit of color as clouds hit an eastern hill, and a lonesome tree.  I recognized I needed to rent a longer lens so I could isolate further subjects, and added that to my list for later that day.

#### First Day of Riding

I caught the city bus to Teton Village, a solid 45 minutes of heating up in a crowded bus, then froze while grabbing my lift ticket and waiting for the Jackson Hole tram.  I had a great day, mostly exploring the southern side of the park, in the less groomed more remote terrain, finding some leftover powder from the previous weeks dump in the trees, quickly grabbing 5 laps before a morning break.

My previous trip to Jackson had very little snow on the mountain, so exploring Jackson with deep snow was something I have been looking forward to for years - and it was fantastic.  In the early afternoon, I did the short hike up the headwall, and was rewarded with a quick powder run through a bowl.

I grabbed a light lunch, cruised some groomers, then was ready to head home and grab a nap - it was an early start and a long day.

#### Sunset

After grabbing a late afternoon nap, I rushed to the cool Jackson Camera store, met @isaacsphotos (( Instagram Link )) and rented a long lens.  150-600mm!!  I see why they call this thing a bazooka.  

I headed back up Gros Ventre road, and knocked out a few obligatory shots at a long distance to see what this thing could do.  The peaks started to show themselves as well, which really added to the excitement.  The Teton range is truely incredible.  

While I heard reports of big horn sheep, moose, etc... I didn't spot any that evening.  It really would have been fantastic to see last nights coyotes with this evenings zoom range.  The warm spring past Kelly however, really provided an epic mist with geese and others landing in the fog.

After helping a snowmobiler fix their trailer, we turned around caught a wonderful sunrise over the peaks with a farmhouse and lake in the foreground.
