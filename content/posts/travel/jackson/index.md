### Introduction

After complaining enough about not getting a quick west coast ski trip in, Melissa offered to let me take a few days to myself in Jackson Hole prior to meeting with the family in Steamboat for our usual winter family ski trip.

### Arrival & Scouting

I arrived at Jackson Hole airport around midday, and after somehow losing my luggage at the worlds smallest airport, jumped in the rental car and started scouting locations.  Driving north into Grand Teton National Park, I scoped out Glacier View, Snake River View, and a couple other turnouts from the road.

February 2019 set multiple snow records for Jackson, and the pulloffs required a climb up a four to six foot wall of snow and ice.  The clouds were also low, only exposing the first 800-1000 feet of the Teton mountain range, but gentle enough to provide some great soft light on the pillowy cliffs and misty trees over the Snake River.  

In addition to the pull-offs, I drove far enough to see a heard of bison at the entrance to a ranch - the first I've seen those.  They are huge - and were close enough to me that I was a bit nervous of parking too close, and definitely didn't get out of the car.

I made a few attempts at walking off a few of the pull-offs, but it was clearly snow-shoe conditions, as I sunk in the snow up to my waist everytime I attempted to get off the road.  I thought about finding some this trip, but the days were short and busy, and I didn't end up picking up a pair.
