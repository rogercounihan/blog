### Introduction

After complaining enough about not getting a quick west coast ski trip in, Melissa offered to let me take a few days to myself in Jackson Hole prior to meeting with the family in Steamboat for our usual winter family ski trip.

### Arrival & Scouting

I arrived at Jackson Hole airport around midday, and after somehow losing my luggage at the worlds smallest airport, jumped in the rental car and started exploring.  Driving north into Grand Teton National Park, I scoped out Glacier View, Snake River View, and a couple other turnouts from the road.

February 2019 set multiple snow records for Jackson, and the pulloffs required a climb up a four to six foot wall of snow and ice.  The clouds were also low, only exposing the first 800-1000 feet of the Teton mountain range, but gentle enough to provide some great soft light on the pillowy cliffs and misty trees over the Snake River.  

In addition to the pull-offs, I drove far enough to see a heard of bison at the entrance to a ranch - the first bison I've seen those.  They are huge - and were close enough to me that I was a bit nervous of parking too close, and definitely didn't get out of the car.

I made a few attempts at walking off at a the pull-offs, but it was clearly snow-shoe conditions, as I sunk in the snow to my waist everytime I attempted to walk off the road.  I thought about finding a pair of snowshoes this trip, but the days were short and busy, and I didn't end up picking up a pair.

Later that evening, I went back and out explored the Gros-Ventre road.  A bit east of highway 192, and further from the mountains, this was more of an opportunity for wildlife and creative landscape shots.  I wasn't quite feeling my groove that first evening, but did spot a few places to explore in the future, and spotted two coyotes (I did think they were wolves at first).  The small town of Kelly (Wikipedia link for Kelly?) really surprised me most of all.

I drove home in the dark, needing to get unpacked and get ready for a long first day of photography and riding.

### First Full Day - Sunday

#### Sunrise Attempt #1

With a 5am wakeup, I had plenty of time for coffee and getting dressed.  I drove from my hotel near Jackson town square up to Glacier overlook.  I got there in the dark before sunrise, channeling every youtube photographer I follow, but it was obvious the mountains were fully shrouded that first morning.  With the temps hovering around -20F / (( ADD CELSIUS ))

I headed back up Gros Ventrev road, looking for some scenery, and caught a bit of color as clouds hit an eastern hill, and a lonesome tree.  I recognized I needed to rent a longer lens so I could isolate further subjects, and added that to my list for later that day.

#### First Day of Riding

I caught the city bus to Teton Village, a solid 45 minutes of heating up in a crowded bus, then froze while grabbing my lift ticket and waiting for the Jackson Hole tram.  I had a great day, mostly exploring the southern side of the park, in the less groomed more remote terrain, finding some leftover powder from the previous weeks dump in the trees, quickly grabbing 5 laps before a morning break.

My previous trip to Jackson had very little snow on the mountain, so exploring Jackson with deep snow was something I have been looking forward to for years - and it was fantastic.  In the early afternoon, I did the short hike up the headwall, and was rewarded with a quick powder run through a bowl.

I grabbed a light lunch, cruised some groomers, then was ready to head home and grab a nap - it was an early start and a long day.

#### Sunset

After grabbing a late afternoon nap, I rushed to the cool Jackson Camera store, met @isaacsphotos (( Instagram Link )) and rented a long lens.  150-600mm!!  I see why they call this thing a bazooka.  

I headed back up Gros Ventre road, and knocked out a few obligatory shots at a long distance to see what this thing could do.  The peaks started to show themselves as well, which really added to the excitement.  The Teton range is truely incredible.  

While I heard reports of big horn sheep, moose, etc... I didn't spot any that evening.  It really would have been fantastic to see last nights coyotes with this evenings zoom range.  The warm spring past Kelly however, really provided an epic mist with geese and others landing in the fog.  While there, I met a couple other photographers enjoying the clear view of the mountains and the color that evening.

After helping a snowmobiler fix their trailer, we turned around caught a wonderful sunrise over the peaks with a farmhouse and lake in the foreground.

### Second Full Day - Monday

#### Sunrise Attempt #2

Another early start, driving up to Grand Teton National Park, I aimed for the iconic Snake River overlook.  At first, my access to the overlook was blocked by bison and some protective park rangers!  After some creative driving, I got into the overlook, and got to the mountains as blue light started to open up the Teton range.

While there were not incredible clouds, the alpen-glow and scenery was still incredible.  I bounced between different focal lengths and compositions, playing with different elements to see what I thought came together best.  Without clouds, long exposure didn't seem to make sense, but instead I tried to capture the mist in the trees and the reflection on the river.  

After this successful morning, it was time for a great day on the slopes.  I again found my best run after a headwall hike, this time walking past rendezvous bowl, and heading to the Casper Chutes - which turned out to be very accessible.  While the slopes weren't fresh powder soft, the conditions were still very steep, and I found plenty of fun run.

#### Evening Day 2

I did call it a day a bit early, as I was pretty drained from the early starts the past few days.  After a nap, it was back out on the road.  As it was my last chance with the long lens, I was committed to finding moose.

And I did!  Nothing epic, but moose were in the trees, in the bushes, and by the river.  This was up the same road I had explored the previous evening.  Sunset was also a bit of a non-event after the mornings fireworks.  I attempted some full moon photography once the sun was fully down - testing the high - ISO capabilities of the D750.

### Third Full Day - Tuesday

#### Skiing

OK - I skipped sunrise this morning.  I wanted a full day of skiing, and the early starts had taken it out of me.  I also needed to make a rental car switch for logistical purposes.

The skiing was great again.  Before lunch, I did a different side of the headwall, and rode all the way from top to bottom.  As I approached the base area, two moose jumped out of the trees, and ran down the trail.  Also, as a final hurrah after lunch, I found more fresh snow on the far north side of the mountain that I had not explored over the past few days.

#### Evening Photos

I headed off in a different direction, scouting out the road that I'd be driving out the following morning.  There were a number of pullouts, but they were plowed in and it was impossible to pull off the road.  I reached a snowmobile track, and tried to take some shots of a frozen river or a dramatic sunset, but didn't find anything.
