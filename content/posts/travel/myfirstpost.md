### Day 1 Travel and Start

### Day 2 Morning

Julian slept in on our first morning (the first of many accomodations) - but that afforded me some time to take some sunrise pictures.  I think at this point I immediately recognized that I should have brought my tripod.  And cut down on the number of olives I carried.
