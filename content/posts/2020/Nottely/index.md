We closed on a new cottage on Lake Nottely in North Georgia two weeks ago, and have started to spend our spare weekend time up there. 

It is a very small cottage, with a beautiful view of a mountain and the water. It has multiple balconies and patios which we will likely spend a significant amount of our time on.  The inside is currently fairly dark, with the exception of the master bedroom.  

It has a small dock, which right now is fairly low from the cabin, as the water level of the lake drops off severely. It will be perfect for some quick sails on the extra Melges 14, and just big enough to dock the Lund on.

So far though, we've only used the canoe that came with the cabin, and hopefully the rest of the boats will be cleared out by the previous owner shortly.

This weekend we moved in beds, bought a big pile of firewood, brought up some kitchen supplies, setup the internet, TV, and some smoke detectors.  It was a good mix of relaxing and being productive. The sunrise was very beautiful, and Melissa and I both took the kids for different paddles. We also took advantage of the uhaul trailer to bring a large quantity of wood home with us!

Despite being November, the weather was warm and sunny, only cooling off late in the evening. The trees, however, had turned a spectacular shade of red. We're planning on spending some significant time up there during Thanksgiving, and hopefully the weather will continue its current trajectory.
